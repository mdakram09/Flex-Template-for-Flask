    let par2 = "They called their goodbyes and the train pulled out of the station. As I was totally blind at the time, my eyes sensitive only to light and darkness, I was unable to tell what the girl looked like. But I knew she wore slippers from the way they slapped against her heels.";
    let par3 = "It would take me some time to discover something about her looks and perhaps I never would. But I liked the sound of her voice and even the sound of her slippers. 'Are you going all the way to Dehra? I asked.";
    let par4 = "I must have been sitting in a dark corner because my voice startled her. She gave a little exclamation and said, I didn't know anyone else was here.'Well, it often happens that people with good eyesight fail to see what is right in front of them. They have too much to take in, I suppose.";
    let par5 = "Whereas people who cannot see (or see very little) have to take in only the essentials, whatever registers tellingly on their remaining senses.I didn't see you either,' I said. 'But I heard you come in.' I wondered if I would be able to prevent her from discovering that I was blind. Provided I keep to my seat, I thought, it shouldn't be too difficult. The girl said, I am getting off at Saharanpur. My aunt is meeting me there.'";
    let par6 = "Then I had better not get too familiar/ I replied. 'Aunts are usually formidable creatures.' 'Where are you going?' she asked. 'To Dehra and then to Mussoorie.' 'Oh, how lucky you are. I wish I were going to Mussoorie. I love the hills. Especially in October.' 'Yes, this is the best time,' I said, calling on my memories. The hills are covered with wild dahlias, the sun is delicious, and at night you can sit in front of a log fire and drink a little brandy. Most of the tourists have gone and the roads are quiet and almost deserted. Yes, October is the best time.'";
    let par7 = "She was silent. I wondered if my words had touched her or whether she thought me a romantic fool. Then I made a mistake. 'What is it like outside?' I asked. She seemed to find nothing strange in the question. Had she noticed already that I could not see? But her next question removed my doubts.";
    let par8 = "'Why don't you look out of the window?' she asked.I moved easily along the berth and felt for the window ledge. The window was open and I faced it, making a pretence of studying the landscape. I heard the panting of the engine, the rumble of the wheels, and, in my mind's eye I could see telegraph posts flashing by.";
    let par9 = "'Have you noticed,' I ventured, 'that the trees seem to be moving while we seem to be standing still?' That always happens,' she said. 'Do you see any animals?' 'No,' I answered quite confidently. I knew that there were hardly any animals left in the forests near Dehra. I turned from the window and faced the girl and for a while we sat in silence.";

'She was an interesting girl/ I said. 'Can you tell meâ€”did she keep her hair long or short?' 'I don't remember/ he said sounding puzzled. 'It was her eyes I noticed, not her hair.
